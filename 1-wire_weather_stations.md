# 1-Wire Weather Stations

Interest has grown about creating weather stations and setting up a data input into a Collexion database for testing, analysis, and to create a software system that can be used for learning and experimentation. We will put together weather stations using pre-built components to get started in the hobby, and then we will branch out into data integration, manually building components, adding data warehousing and analytics, and more!

We can build a 1-Wire Weather Station using the Weather Toys book as a source. The book is broken down into 3 parts.

* Introduction to weather, introduction to weather stations, and introduction to 1-wire devices.

* Build a Weather Station

* Temperature

* Wind Speed and Wind Direction

* Humidity

* Barometric Pressure

* Rainfall

* Lightning

* Expanding the Weather Station

* Build a Weather Web Server

* Turn Appliances On or Off Based on Weather

* Add an LED display

* Build a Smart Sprinker Timer

* Build a Home Thermostat

* Build a Stand-Alone Weather Station (no PC required)
