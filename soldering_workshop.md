# Soldering Workshop

Conduct a soldering workshop to educate the community and drum up interest in DIY activities!



##Project ideas:


* [Solar-powered Pummer](http://www.solarbotics.net/library/circuits/bot_pummer.html) nocturnal light flasher (cost + parts list? $15-$20?)

* [TV-B-Gone](http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=20&products_id=73) mischief-maker ($19.50 @ AdaFruit)

* [Alarm Clock](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9205) ($24.95 @ Sparkfun)

* [Electronic Dice](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10212) ($19.95 @ Sparkfun)

* [MintyBoost](http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=10&products_id=14) ($19.50 @ AdaFruit)

* [USB BoarDuino](http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=19&products_id=91) ($25.00 @ AdaFruit)Note: AdaFruit offers a 
[40% discount](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2010/06/01/big-news-all-hacker-spaces-in-the-world-get-adafruit-reseller-pricing-starting-today/) on kits purchased by hackerspaces, with a $250 minimum order. That's probably $250 post-discount, right?



##Workshop Organization:


* Borrow soldering irons from the community, purchase as few as possible (40W+).

* Make sure the space has solder, flux, desoldering braid, and tip-cleaning supplies like cellulose sponges.

* Find a way to project live video for instructor demonstration.

* Advertise, maybe point out common uses for soldering?
