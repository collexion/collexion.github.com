Collexion offers workshops and classes on a variety of technology, DIY, and life hacking topics. We suggest signing up early but you're always welcome to drop in! We'd love to have you participate! Most classes are free or have suggested donations that go to keep Collexion running. We're a non-profit, you know! Anyone is welcome to participate and anyone is welcome to start their own class on their topic of expertise or interest!

Please contact the instructor of the class you're interested in for more information!  To encourage an instructor to offer a class below, add your name to the "I want this!" line for each class below.  Don't see what you want?  Add it to the Wish List section below!

##Class Details


###CNC Router Workshop


Instructor: TBD

Dates: TBD

So we've got this shiny new CNC Router -- Learn how to use it!  Vote for this class to make it happen!

###Welding in 60 Minutes


Date: 
Tuesday, Sept 27, 2011 - 6:30 - 9:00 PM (brownbag at 6 PM)  
Class size is limited to six students.

Learn the basics of MIG welding.  This is amateur hour - not intended for structural applications or professional advancement.  Everyone gets to make sparks and go home with a doodle in steel.

Wear clothing remarkably similar to this:

*A full-face welder's mask -- REQUIRED! You can probably borrow one from a friend, or buy a cheapie at HF for around $20(?)  (Contact me if you can't find one...I have one clunker that will be adequate)


*Nasty jeans


*Closed-toe shoes


*Sturdy long-sleeve all-cotton shirt (no melty polyester!) that you don't love very much


*Baseball hat or cotton do-rag.


*Gloves. You don't want massive fire-fighting gloves -- a pair of light leather or sturdy cotton garden gloves are adequate.


*Clear face shield (preferred) or safety goggles.  Optional.Bring some clean steel bits if you want to make something pretty out of them.  Otherwise, we'll provide some scraps to play with.

If anyone can bring another welder students can use, that would give everyone more time under the hood.  Ditto for an angle grinder or two.

Hazards: Temporary blindness. Headache. Minor burns. Electrocution. Laceration. Death.

About: A workshop where will build our own "breaduino" and eventually work on a project like "wireless temp monitoring"

Vote for this: dhempy



###Craftmaking with a 3D Printer


Instructor: 
[Nikolai Warner](mailto:n@nikolaiwarner.com)

Dates: TBA, please notify instructor if you're interested in attending

About: Take your folking crafts into the future with an injection of 3D printer technology.

###Dream Hacking


Instructor: 
[Nikolai Warner](mailto:n@nikolaiwarner.com)

Dates: TBA, please notify instructor if you're interested in attending

About: Take advantage of all that time you spend asleep! Learn how to make your dreams rock! Each week we'll explore techniques and technologies for having totally rad dreams and we'll share our individual progresses into our minds!

###Hackerspace  Workshop Development


Instructor: 
[Nikolai Warner](mailto:n@nikolaiwarner.com)

Dates: TBA, please notify instructor if you're interested in attending

About: A workshop about workshops! Learn how to develop and start your own community education class. Have an idea for something you'd like to learn more about or teach others about? We'll help you develop your class in our class! Tre meta!

###Homebrew School


Instructor: TBD

Dates: TBD

About: Learn how to make beer, wine, and other brewed things at home.

Vote for this: xtoddx



###Improvisational Acting


Instructor: 
[Nikolai Warner](mailto:n@nikolaiwarner.com)

Dates: TBD

About: Learn the basics of improv acting. Maybe we'll build a troupe out of it!

Vote for this:



###OpenCV


Instructor: 
[Bill Dieter](mailto:bdieter@escenttech.com)

Dates: TBD, please notify instructor if you would like to attend and we will work out dates and times.

About: Computer vision is the field of trying to extract meaning from the contents of static images or video.  
[OpenCV](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/) implements many common image processing and computer vision algorithms in an open source C++ library.  It is designed to speed up creation of computer vision applications by removing the drudgery of re-implementing well known algorithms.  OpenCV compiles and runs under Linux, Mac, and Windows and has drivers for most common web cams, as well as high end cameras.

The goal of this class is to introduce OpenCV and build a few simple programs with OpenCV and using Qt to provide a GUI interface.  At the end of the class, students will be ready to explore OpenCV in more depth for their own projects.

Prerequisites: Passing knowledge of C/C++, a computer with network interface, a web cam

###Ferment This!


Instructor: 
[Mick Jeffries](mailto:mickjeffries@insightbb.com)

Date: TBD  (1-2 hours depending on turnout)

About: Take a look at the Tea Monster and other fermented beverages! Fermentation is fun because it's evidence that nature does a pretty good job without our help. We'll take a look at the simple basics of 
[Kombucha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha) tea and 
[Kefir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kefir).

Bring: A gallon glass jar. The kind you make sun tea in is fine, for example.

I'll bring some Kombucha "babies" and depending on turnout, some or all of us can leave with a Kombucha ferment.

Hazards: Some will think it gross? Maybe an upset stomach?

##Want to start your own class?


First of all, you rock! Take the first step and contact Nikolai Warner 
[[1]](mailto:n@nikolaiwarner.com) to get more info and find a spot in the schedule! Really, all you need is some enthusiasm about a topic and the time to lead others in learning about it. Experts not required! Heck, just learn while you lead! You might also consider attending the Hackerspace  Workshop Development class to refine your class and get prepared a bit.



##Class Wish List (Don't see what you're looking for?)


Can't find that Underwater Basketweaving you've been searching for?  Add it here!  No telling what skills lurk within your neighbor, just itching to invade your brain!

*3D Modelling (particularly for CNC fabrication) (I want this: dhempy)


*Metal lathe (I want this: )


*Vertical mill (I want this: )
