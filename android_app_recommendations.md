Prey

Remote recovery and/or wipe in case of theft

OSSish; "Prey does your basic locate/lock/alarm, but doesn't have remote wipe or a companion app for live location from another phone (works through email or the website). I like Prey because it's open, the people seem privacy-minded, and it's also available for PCs. The PC version can operate independently of their service, activating when it detects a 404 not found for a file at a URL you control."Lookout

Remote recovery and/or wipe in case of theft

Free, as in beer; I think Lookout is the most popular. They also make "Plan B" that you can remotely install from the Market's web interface if you forgot to install a tracker before your device was misplaced/stolen, which is a clever trick.Where's My Droid



unobtrusive; Wheres my Droid can ring (optionally with a custom tone) or reply with GPS coordinates from text or email based on code phrases. There is a paid version with remote wiping capability, but I don't have it upgraded.  It also has an option to send an alert if the SIM is swapped in your device.Web Browsing

Chrome to Phone

Send clipboard & links to your tablet from your browser (Firefox extension available)Location

GPS Status

Technical readout of GPS parameters

Started ad-free, now has semi-intrusive adsLlama

Awesome location- and time-of-day-based settings management 
 using battery-hungry GPS. Can assign observed cell towers or wifi/bluetooth devices to locations, then change settings when entering/leaving. I have it disable GPS and enable wifi when I get home, start my podcast app (Google Listen) when I connect line out in the car. You can also create desktop shortcuts to gangs of actions.

AwesomeNetwork

Wifi Analyzer

Wifi site survey showing who's on what channel; Can do audible signal strength indicator

dumps the su binary in the right place, and provides a nice GUI to manage permissions

required for technical users to find Android usable (rooted device required)BusyBox

command line shell

required for technical users to find Android usable (rooted device required)Other recommendations and helpful info for Android phones/tablets:

* Don't forget to add the built-in Power Control Widget to one of your desktops if it's not already there. Nice quick toggles for various hardware bits.* The two largest/most functional Android hacking communities I've come across are rootzwiki.com and xda-developers.com  They both have some internet politics and drama, and n00bhorde problems that come with being for a dominant platform, but you can usually shake the information you need out of their forums and wikis.
