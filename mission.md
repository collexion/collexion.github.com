### General Mission

Collexion is an organization focused on sustainability,
personal improvement, and community enrichment
for people from techincal and artistic backgrounds
in Central Kentucky.

Or put another way: come nerd out with your new friends.

### A Focus Technology and Art

We are interested in technology and art
because they are are tools of influence.

Also, making things is fun.

### As a Collective

Fun is more fun when you're not alone.
Teach something,
attend a workshop,
and socialize with other creative people.

We hope you'll make new friends,
develop new skills,
and pursue new opportunities
though the people you meet.

### Just Enough Resources

We are not focused on tools and infrastructure.
A minimal set of tools and space are all that is needed to meet friends,
experiment with new ideas,
and build things.

Learning to use this tool and that tool lead to process-oriented thinking.
We want to foster creativity,
which is opposed to process.
Generally speaking, tools are easy to come by and acquire.
Likeminded, creative people are a much scarcer sort of thing.
