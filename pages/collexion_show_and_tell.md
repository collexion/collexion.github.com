# Collexion Show and Tell

"Collexion Show and Tell" is a new series at Collexion where one of us gets an hour or so to just present great stuff.

There are no rules, no pressure, just fun. The presenter could show a movie, or surf some webpages, teach us juggling, or guide us on a discussion topic. It's all about interesting stuff that we like and ideally might help inspire others.

##Presenter Schedule


*March 9 - 7:30pm: nikolaiwarner


*Who's next?....

##Presenters: Preparing For Your Event


*Don't worry. Just have fun.


*Prepare a little, not a lot. Go with our flow.
