# E-Day 2011

"Engineers Day, or E-day, is a celebration of everything engineering has to offer." 
[UK Engineers Day Open House](http://www.engr.uky.edu/eday/2011/)

We brought acrylic that the kids etched and then glow with a LED and battery, showed off the adruino, and made a drawbot from a plastic cup, markers, and a vibrating motor.  Special thanks goes to xtoddx for bringing the supplies and being generally awesome.
